= Chain Base Page =

This page serves as the foundation of a dependency chain. It is the base level that other pages in the chain depend on.

== Overview ==

The chain base page provides fundamental concepts that are built upon by [[chain mid page]], which in turn is built upon by [[chain top page]]. This creates a three-level dependency chain.

== Chain Structure ==

This page is the base of the following chain:
* [[chain base page]] (this page) - base level
* [[chain mid page]] - depends on this page
* [[chain top page]] - depends on chain mid page

== Core Concepts ==

This page establishes the core concepts and data structures that the entire chain depends on. It contains the foundational principles that [[chain mid page]] extends and [[chain top page]] implements.

== Implementation ==

As the base of the chain, this page must be imported first before any other pages in the chain can function properly. This tests the import system's ability to handle sequential dependencies.
