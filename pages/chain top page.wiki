= Chain Top Page =

This page is the top level in a three-level dependency chain. It depends on [[chain mid page]], which in turn depends on [[chain base page]].

== Overview ==

The chain top page represents the highest level of abstraction in the dependency chain. It builds upon both [[chain base page]] and [[chain mid page]] to provide complete functionality.

== Chain Hierarchy ==

This page is at the top of the following dependency chain:
* [[chain base page]] - foundation level
* [[chain mid page]] - intermediate level
* [[chain top page]] - this page (top level)

== Complete Implementation ==

This page provides the complete implementation that incorporates all the concepts from [[chain base page]] and the intermediate functionality from [[chain mid page]]. It represents the final, fully-featured component in the chain.

== Complex Dependencies ==

This page depends on:
* [[chain mid page]] - for intermediate functionality
* [[chain base page]] - indirectly through chain mid page

== Testing Complex Chains ==

This page tests the import system's ability to handle complex dependency chains where pages depend on other pages that in turn depend on additional pages. The import order must be: chain base → chain mid → chain top.
