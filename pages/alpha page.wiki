= Alpha Page =

This page is part of the dependent pack, which depends on the [[pages only pack]]. It demonstrates how pages can have dependencies on other packs.

== Overview ==

The alpha page builds upon the foundation provided by the pages only pack. It specifically references content from [[pages only page 1]] and [[pages only page 2]].

== Dependencies ==

This page depends on:
* [[pages only page 1]] - provides core functionality
* [[pages only page 2]] - provides extended features

== Functionality ==

This page extends the capabilities of the pages only pack by adding alpha-specific features. It demonstrates how a dependent pack can build upon existing functionality while adding its own unique value.

== Usage ==

When importing the dependent pack, users must also import the pages only pack first, or the links to [[pages only page 1]] and [[pages only page 2]] will be broken. This tests the dependency resolution functionality of the import system.
