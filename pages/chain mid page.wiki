= Chain Mid Page =

This page is the middle level in a three-level dependency chain. It depends on [[chain base page]] and is depended upon by [[chain top page]].

== Overview ==

The chain mid page builds upon the foundation provided by [[chain base page]] and provides intermediate functionality that [[chain top page]] relies on.

== Chain Position ==

This page is in the middle of the following dependency chain:
* [[chain base page]] - provides foundation (depends on this)
* [[chain mid page]] - this page (depends on chain base)
* [[chain top page]] - builds on this page

== Intermediate Functionality ==

This page provides intermediate functionality that bridges the gap between the basic concepts in [[chain base page]] and the advanced implementation in [[chain top page]]. It extends the base concepts and prepares them for the top-level implementation.

== Dependencies ==

This page depends on:
* [[chain base page]] - for foundational concepts

== Dependents ==

This page is used by:
* [[chain top page]] - for advanced implementation

== Import Order ==

When importing this page, the system must ensure that [[chain base page]] is imported first, and this page must be imported before [[chain top page]] to maintain the proper dependency chain.
