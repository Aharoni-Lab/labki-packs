# labki-packs (content) – temporary docs

These documents are intended for the `labki-packs` content repository. They are staged here temporarily and should be moved there.

- See `docs/overview.md` for goals and scope
- See `docs/repo-structure.md` for the expected layout
- See `docs/schema.md` for the manifest fields and links to schemas
- See `docs/using-validator.md` for how to validate with `labki-packs-tools`
